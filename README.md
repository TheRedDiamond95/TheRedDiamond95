- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheRedDiamond95
-  Iâ€™m interested in engineering, mainly Aeronautical and Automotive. Coding is something that I like to do sometimes in my free time, so I decided to join GitHub.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of code. I am a beginner, and only know a few things here and there in Python and HTML. I'm looking to improve my skills with dev tools and just code in general as well.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple projects that allow me to expand my skillset and increase my knowledge of the World called Cyberspace.
-  How to reach me: My discord is "thatonedevman". Feel free to DM me any time! 
-  Pronouns: He/Him
-  Fun fact: I actually drew engine blueprints for a completely new type of engine! So, you could say I invented it!
